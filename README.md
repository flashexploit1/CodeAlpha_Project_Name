# CodeAlpha_Project_Name
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project as part of my remote internship at CodeAlpha! ðŸš€  I've built a basic network sniffer in Python, utilizing the powerful Scapy library. This tool captures and logs probe requests from devices searching for Wi-Fi networks, providing valuable insights into network traffic.
